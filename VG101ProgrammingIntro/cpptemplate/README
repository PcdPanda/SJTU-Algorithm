Dear all:

Welcome to the last part of this course. This is the cpp homework
template. The basic use of the files remains unchanged. 

Please note:
In CPP you will encounter rather large project. Project don't need 
to comply to this homework template. 

In CPP there exists a very unique techique, also named "template", 
in this file, "template" means "homework template".

USAGE:
Write your corresponding exercise in the CPP files. Note that the file 
extention for cpp source files are usually ".cpp". In real life you might
also find some cpp source files ends with ".cc" or ".cx". We stick to ".cpp".
Header files still ends with ".h". However do note that standard library header
files don't ends with ".h".  Also, C standard library headers all have thier
own cpp version, such as "stdlib.h" becomes "cstdlib".

COMPILING:
For command line, run 

g++ -Wall -pedantic main.cpp ex1.cpp ex2.cpp ex3.cpp ex4.cpp -o out -lfreeglut -lopengl32

g++ is the compiler for cpp. This course allow C++ 2011 standard. 

Extra information:
Future notes:
You will soon begin writing program with OpenGL library. 

Windows user might need to include "windows.h" for the program to compile.

Program with OpenGL would require special compiling commands. 
We will cover this in future lab.
