USAGE AND COMPLING:
For command line, run 
gcc -Wall main.c ex1.c ex2.c ex3.c ex4.c ex5.c ex6.c -o out

Ex1:
Input:
None.

Output:
The Cartesian number will be output in the form of Polar coordinate and the Polar coordinate ones are vice versa.

Explanation about my struct:
For Cartesian, I use r and i to represent the real part and imaginary part
For polar coordinate, I use r and a to represent the absoluate value and the complex angle of the number
I think the Cartesian is better because it is more clear and coomplex angle is not convenient when it is k*M_PI
For data types, I choose float because it's more precisely and the value of trigonometric functions are oftern decimals


Algorithm:
The function uses trigonometric functions to convert complex numbers between different forms.

Ex2:
Input:
The number of input integers and a string including the integers separated by spaces

Output:
The numbers of valid numbers and spaces. The max number, the random number and the input numbers which are larger than the random number.

Algorithm:
The function use pointers and ASCII code to find spaces in the string and the numbers.

Ex3:
Input:
Two txt files called sentence and word and include them. 

Output:
A txt file called count showing how many times the word occurs in the sentence

Alogrithm:
The function uses different kinds of pointers to read string from files and output them to a file.

Ex4:
Input:
A file including the two matrixes
Note the number of lines and rows must be same or the product or the sum will be meaningless.

Output:
The sum, product and transpose output in a file called result

Algorithm:
The function will read the matrixes by using pointers and two-dimension array.
It also uses algorithm in Ex2 to find the space in the string 

Ex5:
Input:
Nothing. You can use functions as required in the main function.I also wrote a function called print to help know the elements in the set.
There has been an example in the main function

Output:
If you use print function, it will print all the elements in the set

(a):
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. 
It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.

(b):
Josephus problem, the calculation of polynomial£¬memory manangement in operating system

(c):
Singly linked list, doubly linked list, multiply linked list, circular linked list

Input:
Nothing.

Output:
The element of the linked list as required.

Algorithem:
The function use pointers and structs of nodes to operate on a linked list.
