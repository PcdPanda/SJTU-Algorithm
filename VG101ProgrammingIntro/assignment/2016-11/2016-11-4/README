USAGE AND COMPLING:
For command line, run 
gcc -Wall main.c ex1.c ex2.c ex3.c ex4.c ex5.c -o out

Ex1:
Input:
The coefficients of the real part and the imaginary part of the two complex numbers and the operation symbols like * and +

Output:
The product or sum of the two complex numbers.

You need to enter the coefficients of the real part and the imaginary part of the two complex numbers orderly as the requirement.
For example, if you enter 1 2 3 4 + orderly,the function will calcuate the sum of 1+2i and 3+4i and print 4+6i.
For example, if you enter 1 2 3 4 * orderly,the function will calcuate the product of 1+2i and 3+4i and print -5+10i.
The function will provide you with instruction about what to enter.

Ex2:
Input:
Two positive integers

Output:
Their GCD

Algorithm:
Use a recusion function.First,assume the GCD is the bigger integer,then keeping calculating the remainder and decreasing the GCD until it can
be divided by 2 integers with no remainder.

Ex3:
Input:
A letter or a digit

Output:
If you input a letter,then it will output whether the letter is a vowel.
If you enter a digit, the function 3 will require you to enter a b or B again as a unit and print the correspoding data types

The function uses ASCII code to distinguish digits from letters

Ex4:
Input:
The three coefficients of a quadratic equation

Output:
The real roots of the equation

The function uses formula for roots to calculate the roots.

Ex5:
Input:
Two numbers

Output:
Two numbers with their values exchanged

The function will print the process of changing their values without any temporary variable.
